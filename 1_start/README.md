### **Overview**
This project demonstrates a simple responsive static website using HTML5 structure and CSS styling. The design includes a header, main content area, blog section, sidebar navigation and contact details, and a footer — all styled with modern CSS principles and basic semantic HTML markup. The layout emphasizes content organization, readability, and separation of structure and style, making it suitable for learning fundamentals of web layout and page design.
